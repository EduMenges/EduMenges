# Hi there.

I am **Edu**ardo **Menges** Mattje. I'm a Computer Science bachelor and currently work as a C++ software engineer.

## Projects

### [SuperGenius](https://github.com/GeniusVentures/SuperGenius/tree/develop)
  
This is the project I'm currently working on, for GeniusVentures. It is an SDK for decentralized AI jobs processing that utilizes the untapped power GPUs have when running apps like games.

### [Toy language compiler](https://github.com/joaoPauloDias/compilers)

This compiler was done during my Compiler course at Uni. It was the first time I used an arena allocator instead of the usual malloc/free structure and I'm glad to say I felt free (get it?) using it.

### [Dropbox clone](https://github.com/EduMenges/dropbox)

This was for the Concurrency and Distributed Systems course, it is a Dropbox clone using raw TCP sockets with server replication. It sounds fancy, but the implementation was unnecessarily complex and error prone. I think of it as a failure, but it was a turning point on my software engineer career in whcih I understood that, contrary to what clean code says, more abstracions does not lead to better code.

### [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics final project](https://github.com/EduMenges/fcg-final)

A rough clone of Overcooked, Undercooked, because under cooked it was. Various basic CG techiniques were employed, and we used OpenGL with no engines.

### [Fundamentals of Image Processing final project](https://github.com/EduMenges/FPI)

This is a basic image editing software, allowing linear operations and convolution. I used Rust and eGUI to implement everything and it surprisingly works.
